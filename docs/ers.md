## Data from telemetry


### Donnington

braking zone 1
- at 145km/h it starts to sawtooth until 114.4km/h (braking point: 213m)
- at 143km/h it starts to sawtooth until 114km/h (braking point: 214m)

braking zone 2
at 23.5% pedal force, it starts to sawtooth at 52km/h until 28.5 km/h

## Power Generation
(Note: braking is done at a fixed percentage)
- brake pedal must be atleast 50% to achieve maximum peak 120,000 J/s generation
- ERS will ALWAYS stop generating power when power generation distance is 99 meters or longer
- Before completely stopping power generation it sawtooths at 60 meters
- If throttle is engaged MGU-K will not generate power nor will MGU-H, even 1% throttle will stop it from generating power!
- If you reduce brake pressure as the car slows down as you normally would, the sawtooth effect disapepars, instead there is a nice slope that goes down, looking similar to the graph of brake pressure.

## How to find power generated by certain brake pressure?
We know that 50% or above brake pressure equals to a peak power generation of 120,000J/s, that would mean a percent of braking force is equal to 2400 Joules up to 50% braking force. This has a very low margin of error until you get under 10% braking force, but it will do for now
